It will inform you about malware (virus, trojans, worms) on your phone and allows you to upload any
unknown applications to VirusTotal. In other words, VirusTotal for Android will get your
applications scanned by more than 50 antivirus, flagging any undesired content.
Please note that VirusTotal for Android does not provide real-time protection and, so, is no
substitute for any antivirus product, just a second opinion regarding your apps.
